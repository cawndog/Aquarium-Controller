# Aquarium-Controller

This project started as a DIY heater controller for my aquarium. After my heater controller that I had purchased on Amazon quit working, I decided that it would be fun to make my own using an ESP32, servo motor, and a power switch. It has since expanded to have some form of control over nearly every electronic device in my aquarium. Water sensors have been added to check for leaks and send Email alerts if water is detected to be in a place where it shouldn't be (the floor). The ESP32 controller also closes a motorized ball valve on the filter intake when the water sensors detect a leak.
